## **1. Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>
(Contributed by Simon)

**TrackIt@NUS** is a desktop application for managing modules, lessons, tasks, and contacts, tailored to the needs of
 NUS students. It focuses on the _Command Line Interface (CLI)_ while providing users with a simple and clean
  _Graphical User Interface (GUI)_. The main iteraction with **TrackIt@NUS** will be done via commands.

**TrackIt@NUS** is an all-in-one solution for busy NUS students. The information that can be managed by **TrackIt@NUS** includes:

* Modules
* Lessons (for each module)
* Tasks
* Contacts

By combining these 4 core functions into a single app, we are able to deliver a unique user experience tailored to
 university students. In addition to the standard CRUD operations, students using TrackIt@NUS will be able to:
 
* View all upcoming tasks
* View all module-specific tasks
* View all upcoming lessons
* View all module-specific lessons
* View all contacts
* View all module-specific contacts (i.e. Professors, TAs, friends in the same module)

Any help on the development of TrackIt@NUS would be greatly appreciated, and there are several ways to do so:

* Contribute to the codebase of TrackIt@NUS by expanding the current set of features
* Write new test cases to improve coverage
* Propose and implement improvements for our existing features

The purpose of this Developer Guide is to help you understand the design and implementation of **TrackIt@NUS** so
 that you can get started on your contributions to the app.

## **2. Setting up, getting started** <a name="setup"></a>
(Contributed by Simon)

Refer to the guide [here](./SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Design** <a name="design"></a>

In this section, you will learn about the general design and structure TrackIt@NUS. Subsequently, this section will
 also describe and explain how each component in TrackIt@NUS works individually. TrackIt@NUS is coded using the
  [_Object Oriented Programming_](#oop) paradigm and it follows the [_Facade Pattern_](#facade-p) and [_Command
   Pattern_](#command-p) in software design.

### **3.1 Architecture** <a name="architecture"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https
://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se
-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackitnus/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackitnus/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor & the logic
  interface providing APIs for the UI to retrieve necessary data.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{COMPONENT_NAME}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
 the command `T delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png" width="587" />

Another *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
 clicks on a module tab.

<img src="images/ArchitectureModuleTabSequenceDiagram.png" width="686" />

The sections below give more details of each component.


### **3.2 UI Component** <a name="ui"></a>
(Contributed by Wei Hong)

The Class Diagram below shows how the `UI` components and sections interact with one another.

![UiClassDiagram.png](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
_Figure - Structure of the `Ui` component_

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `SidePanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CommandBox
` as shown in the *Class Diagram* above. All these, including the MainWindow, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. The UI also consist of 4 main
 components:
  1. The `UpcomingTab`
  2. The various `ModuleTab`
  3. The `ContactTab`
  4. The `HelpTab` 

Each of these components may also consist of smaller parts known as cards. A card is a UI component that contains information that is shown to the user. e.g. A `TaskCard` will contain information about a particular task. More details can be found in the respective [sub-sections](#upcoming-tab).

The `UI` component uses **[JavaFx](#javafx)** UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml`  files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.

Each of these tabs consists of one or more List Panels and its respective Card. In each List Panel, the `Graphics` component of each of the List Cells is defined by the respective Card.

The UI component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updathed wit the modified data.

#### **3.2.1. Upcoming Tab** <a name="upcoming-tab"></a>
(Contributed by Tiffany)

The *Class Diagram* below shows how the components in the `Upcoming Tab` interact with each other.
![UiUpcomingTabClassDiagram](images/UiUpcomingTabClassDiagram.png)

:information_source: All the `ListPanels` and `Cards` inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

##### **Responsibilities**
The `Upcoming Tab` consists of a list of an `UpcomingSectionCard` for the Overdue section, 7 `UpcomingSectionDayCards` to represent each day of the next week, and finally another `UpcomingSectionCard` for the Future section. Each `UpcomingSectionCard` comprises of a `TaskPanel` and each `UpcomingSectionDayCard` comprises of a `TaskPanel` and a `LessonPanel`.
The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the calendar feature in the Upcoming tab is populated.

![fillCalendarDiagram](images/fillCalendarDiagram.png)

##### **Flow of adding lessons**
When a user scrolls down the `Upcoming Tab` and reaches a date, the `UpcomingLessonCard` that happens for the day
 will be loaded into the `LessonListPanel` within the `UpcomingSectionDayCard`. The *Activity Diagram* below shows
  how the `UpcomingLessonCards` are added in to result in the display in the `UpcomingPanel`.
  
![UiScrollActivityDiagram](images/UiScrollActivityDiagram.png)

#### **3.2.2. Module Tab** <a name="module-tab"></a>
(Contributed by Wei Hong)

![UiModuleTabClassDiagram.png](images/UiModuleTabClassDiagram.png)

The Class Diagram below shows how `Module Tab` components interact with each other.

This module tab consist of three panels (`LessonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `ContactListPanel`) and their
 corresponding cards (`LessonCard`, `TaskCard`, `ContactCard`). In all of the panels, the graphics of each of the
  `ListCell` is defined by the respective Cards.
  
  The `ContactTab` and `HelpTab` both follow a **similar structure** as the above class diagram, except that they each
   consist of **1 single panel instead of 3**.

### **3.3. Logic Component** <a name="logic"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackitnus/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TrackIterParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/LogicDeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser
` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation in PlantUML, the lifeline continues to the end of the diagram
</div>

### **3.4. Model Component** <a name="model"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackitnus/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the TrackIt@NUS data.
* exposes 4 unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` objects:
    * `filteredModuleList`, which contains all the `Modules` in the TrackIt@NUS
    * `filteredLessonList`, which contains all the `Lessons` in the TrackIt@NUS
    * `filteredTaskList`, which contains all the `Tasks` in the TrackIt@NUS
    * `filteredContactList`, which contains all the `Contacts` in the TrackIt@NUS
* These lists can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

### **3.5. Storage Component** <a name="storage"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackitnus/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the app's data in json format and read it back.

### **3.6. Common Classes** <a name="common"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

The `commons` package contains classes used by multiple other components in the `trackitnus.commons` package.


#### **3.7 Code Design Considerations** <a name="code-des-cons"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

----
**All commands in TrackIt@NUS follow a similar execution flow.**

![Command Activity Diagram](images/CommandActivityDiagram.png)

We have done this to improve maintainability. Making our code more uniform will:

* Make testing easier 
* Allow us to track down bugs faster
* Allow us to better use the Single Level of Abstraction (SLAP) principle in our code

In addition, this will make our code base much more organised, and hence make it easier for new developers to quickly
 learn and contribute.
 
Another design challenge was how to manage our predicates. TrackIt@NUS makes use of many different predicates to
 allow users to view specific tasks, lessons, and contacts. For exmaple, users can view module-specific tasks
 , contacts, and lessons. They can also view overdue tasks and future tasks (tasks where the deadline is more than a
  week away). To manage all these predicates, we had 2 options:


|  | Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| **Option 1 (current choice):** Extract each the predicates into their own unique class | Increases code maintainability and testability. Now as a developer you exactly where to find each predicate. Makes use of the DRY principle and improves abstraction because you no longer need to interact with the actual lambda or test function, simply call the predicate. | Makes code more verbose as each predicate can simply be declared using a single lambda. |
| **Option2:** Declare each predicate using a single lambda in the ModelManager class. No predicate will have a class. | Makes code shorter and simpler to read. No need to create a class when you can simply declare a predicate with a lambda. | Need to duplicate such code when using ModelStubs for testing. This will violate the DRY principle. |

--------

**All classes of Logic & Model at the same level will have similar structures**

![ContactCodeTaskLessonClassDiagram](images/ContactCodeTaskLessonClassDiagram.png)

The above diagram illustrates the structure of 4 classes: Module, Lesson, Contact and Task. 

To elaborate on this design consideration, we will first take an example on some lowest-level classes They include `Email`, `Address`, `Code`, `Name` ....

All of these classes share a similar structure as 2 classes `Address` and `Code` as below:
![CodeAndAddressClassDiagram](images/CodeAndAddressClassDiagram.png)

Furthermore, all Add/Edit/Delete commands will share very similar structure, below is the example of AddCommand, EditCommand & DeleteCommand, 
![AddEditDeleteCommandClassDiagrams](images/AddEditDeleteCommandClassDiagram.png)

The same principle applies to all CommandParser classes.

This will bring several benefits:
* If a bug is found, we can quickly check same-level classes(that have the similar structure) for the existence of the bug since it's quite likely to contain the same bug
* If any fix/improvement is applied to a class, we can quickly apply the same fix/improvement to other same-level classes
* Improve maintainability of the project. Since the back-end was developed in parallel, each developer was assigned to code at least one "part" of the back-end 
(for example, one can be assigned to write all Module-related classes, subclasses, commands and command-parsers). Yet, due to the similarity in structure 
of classes of the same level, it's very easy for a developer to maintain others' codes.

A possible drawback of this uniform design is that it may not be the most appropriate design for each class, but for this project we believe this drawback doesn't apply.

----
**Abstract all low-level logic to Model & Maintain a straight logic flow**

To illustrate this design, please look at the following diagrams for 3 different possible implementation of getModuleContacts():

![GetModuleContactBadSequenceDiagram](images/GetModuleContactBadSequenceDiagram.png)

_The above diagram illustrate the possible design if the UI handles the low-level logic_


![GetModuleContactMediumSequenceDiagram.png](images/GetModuleContactMediumSequenceDiagram.png)

_The above diagram illustrate the possible design if the Logic handles the low-level logic_


![GetModuleContactGoodSequenceDiagram](images/GetModuleContactGoodSequenceDiagram.png)

_The above diagram illustrate the current design of the back-end_

It is easy to see that the current design eliminates all cross-level calls. All methods calls are only in the form a class to itself or to the level right below it.
This helps maintain an uniformed straight logic flow for all functions, which greatly improves maintainability and extensibility. Also, this design better follows the ModelViewController pattern (MVC) since the UI should only be in charged of displaying to users, 
the Logic should only receive events and control the Model and the Model should be the place where all business logic takes place.
 
**In this app, we have tried our very best to ensure almost all (if not all) logic calls follows this principle.**

----
**Other code design rules applied**
* A function/method should only do what it's expected to do (which should be inferable from its name), and in no ways should it surprise the caller.
* Most code snippets that can be reused between classes will be abstracted out to the common Utility classes.
* And design rules from the module's [website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#code-quality)

----
#### **3.8. Feature Design Considerations** <a name="feat-des-cons"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

The entire app follows a simple principle: the app should behave in the way most normal users expect it to behave. 

Its behaviors should help users complete their intended tasks quickly and conveniently, but avoid getting in their way by forcing users to follow some strange constraints.

The following section states some important feature design considerations the team has made during the development of the app

----
**When the module code is edited, all associated lessons/tasks/contact tags are edited as well**

|  | Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| **Option 1 (current choice):** Edit all related all associated lessons/tasks/contact tags| More **intuitive** to users, because it's **natural** to expect that when a module code is edited, its associated lessons/tasks are modified to still belong to the newly edited module and doesn't become "orphan" entities. For contacts, we believe that **most normal** users also expect the app to change the tag associated with the old code to the new code. | It increases coupling of the codebase, make it more prone to bugs |
| **Option2:** Just edit the module code and leave other stuff untouched | Simplify the app's logic, decrease coupling and "possibly", give users more control over the app | **"Surprise"** most users with its **"unexpected"** behavior, and create some weird logic in the app (for example, where can a lesson/task be displayed if it doesn't belong to an existing module) |

**After having considered all the pros & cons, we have decided to implement this feature so that the user can have the best possible User Experience!**

----

**When a module is deleted, all associated lessons/tasks are deleted but contacts are left untouched**

This behavior of the app has been considered (and debated) thoroughly. The following are our rationale:
* We believe it's rare that users need to delete a module (even if they entered the code or name wrongly, they can still edit those fields). So, if they have decided to delete a module, it is likely they have finished(or dropped) that module
, so the app's expected behavior is to delete all the module's associated tasks/lessons.
* Deleting a contact usually means the user no longer want to connect with that contact, which is rarely the case because it's almost always better to have more contacts so that one can seek help when necessary (or "just in case"). 
Hence, we decided to give users full control over their contacts (even the to-be-deleted module's related tag will not be deleted, so that users can keep track of a contact's related modules).

Similar to the previous module edit, one clear drawback of implementing this behavior is it will complicate the app's logic and make the app more bug-prone.

**After having considered all the pros & cons, we have decided to implement this feature so that the user can have the best possible User Experience!**

----

**Allow users to use mouse to click on tabs**

_This feature is one of the most debated features in our team._ 

We are well aware of the module's constraints that the app must be optimized for CLI. 

Yet, 5 todo-apps have been studied by our team (macOS's reminders, Microsoft To Do, Todoist, OmniFocus) and we found all of these apps only have one way to change tabs, and it is by clicking on them. 
Although forcing users to use CLI to change tab can be easily implemented, it will make the app unintuitive to most users (except CLI gurus), and hence **cannot attract new users** to change to our new app from their old apps(of which they are so used to clicking on tabs). 

Also, even for CLI gurus, typing something like `switch CS2030` to switch to a new tab while it can be done with just a single click is not something we think they will do. 

One last reason is that we think it's very convenient for users to use mouse to click on various different tabs in during a short period to just get a sense of upcoming tasks & lessons and related contacts to help them. This "fast jump between tabs" cannot be done by CLI.

----

**Edit/Delete contacts/lessons/tasks by Index**

|  | Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| **Option 1 (current choice):** Use Index to edit/delete | Very "intuitive" for users, they can use the index being displayed to edit/delete the entity they need to | Cannot delete contacts from the upcoming tab. There is no concrete Id for tasks/lessons/contacts, theirs Ids (in this case: index) depends on their position in the current tab|
| **Option2:** Assign each contact/lesson/task a concrete Id | Each entity is associated with only one Id, can edit/delete anywhere in the app | Force users to remember long sequences of Ids and hence create a mental burden everytime they want to edit/delete an entity |

**We have chosen the 1st option to make users feel comfortable using our app**

----
**Unified command syntax**

We have put in a lot of effort to make the command syntax unified, means that all commands have very similar syntax. They can be observed from the following tables:

| Command | Format |
| -- | -------- |
| add module | `M add m/CODE n/NAME` | 
| add lesson | `L add m/CODE t/TYPE d/DATE a/ADDRESS` | 
| add task | `T add n/NAME d/DATE [m/CODE] [r/REMARK]` | 
| add contact | `C add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG]...` | 

| Command | Format |
| -- | -------- |
| edit module | `M edit CODE [m/NEW_CODE] [n/NAME]` | 
| edit lesson | `L edit INDEX [m/CODE] [t/TYPE] [d/DATE] [a/ADDRESS]` | 
| edit task | `T edit INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DATE] [m/CODE] [r/REMARK]` | 
| edit contact | `C edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [t/TAG]...` |

| Command | Format |
| -- | -------- |
| delete module | `M delete CODE` | 
| delete lesson | `L delete INDEX` |
| delete task | `T delete INDEX` | 
| delete contact | `C delete INDEX` | 

| Command | Format |
| -- | -------- |
| help | `help` |
| exit | `exit` |

This will relieve our users from the mental burden of having to remember different syntax for different commands. Although there are only 14 commands to get used to, having to remember all 14 of them will be a huge barrier for our new potential users and also, it will put an unnecessary mental burden on the users of our app.

----

**Other small feature considerations**

|  | Rationale |
| ---- | ----- |
| No limit on length of phone number | We have looked at Android's and iOS's contact app and no app imposes limits on the length of phone number |
| Only basic validation of email address | We believe that the app should only prevent user from accidentally entering phone number/name inside the email field (to provide additional convenience). It's challenging to valid the validity of email (need to check if the domain exists...) yet it's unnecessary since it's the user's own benefits to input valid emails |
| Minimal restriction on lessons' time | We believe that the app should provide users full control over their schedule (for example overlapping lesson time) to cater to a wide range of different users' needs. Moreover, it's the user's own benefits to input maintain a correct lesson schedule |
| Edit/Delete modules by code | Editing/Deleting modules is an action that users will rarely do (maybe a few times every semester). We believe the UI shouldn't be cluttered by some info that users will only need once every semester, so we have decided to omit the Index for modules to make the UI cleaner | 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Implementation** <a name="implementation"></a>

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 **Module Manager** <a name="module-manager"></a>
(Contributed by Simon)

TrackIt@NUS allows users to keep track of all modules that he/she is taking. Module (or more exactly module's code) is
 the link between Lesson, Task and Contact. The following diagram illustrates their relationship:
 
![Module link](images/ModuleLink.png)
     
 :information_source: The module code needs to begin with 2-3 capital letters, then exactly 4 digits, then follows by
  an optional capital letter. The module name must not be empty and doesn't contain character "/"
      
 :information_source: modules are allowed to have the same name, as long as they have different codes
 
 :bulb: Since there is no index being shown for a module, the module can be edited/deleted only by its code. 
 For example: 
 * `M edit CS2030 m/CS2040 n/Edited name` to change the code of CS2030 to CS2040, and change its name to "Edited name"
 * `M delete CS2030` to delete the CS2030 module
 

#### 4.1.1 Current Implementation<a name="module-manager-implementation"></a>
(Contributed by Simon)

In this section, we will outline the key operations of the Module Manager, namely:
* `AddModuleCommand`
* `DeleteModuleCommand`
* `EditModuleCommand`

Before we begin, it is important for us to define 1 key term: **association**:

:information_source: A lesson/task is associated with a module if its **code** field is equal to the
 module's **code**.
 
:information_source: A contact is associated with a module if it contains that module's code as 1 of its tags
 
The add, delete, and edit commands are all implemented in similar ways. When they are executed they will:
 * call on the relevant Model methods
 * update the `UniqueModuleList` depending on the command
 * Save the updated module list to `data/trackIter.json`
 * return the relevant CommandResult message

In this section, we will use the following Activity Diagram to outline the parse & execution of a AddModuleCommand

![Activity diagram for Add Module Command](images/AddModuleCommandActivityDiagram.png)

When the user enters the `M add m/CODE n/NAME` command to add a new module, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in 
[Section 3.3 Logic Component](#33-logic-component). If the parse process is successful, a `AddModuleCommand` will be returned an its `execute` method will be called.

The following steps will describe the execution of the `AddModuleCommand` in detail, assuming no errors are encountered.
1. The `Model`'s `hasModule(code)` is called. If it returns `true`, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
2. The `Model`'s `canAddMoreModule()` is called. If it returns `true`, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. The `Model`'s `addModule()` is called to add the module from TrackIt
4. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the GUI.
5. Assuming the above steps are all successful, the `AddModuleCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The following Sequence Diagram will illustrate the above steps in greater detail :

![Add Module Sequence Diagram](images/AddModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

In this section, we will use the following Activity Diagram to outline the parse & execution of a DeleteModuleCommand

![Activity diagram for Delete Module Command](images/DeleteModuleCommandActivityDiagram.png)

When the user enters the `M delete CODE` command to delete a module, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in 
[Section 3.3 Logic Component](#logic). If the parse process is successful, a `DeleteModuleCommand` will be returned an its `execute` method will be called.

The following steps will describe the execution of the `DeleteModuleCommand` in detail, assuming no errors are encountered.
1. The `Model`'s `getModule(code)` is called and it will return an Optional<Module> to delete. If the returned optional is empty, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
2. The `Model`'s `getModuleTasks()` is called to get the list of tasks that are associated with the module. 
3. For each task received from the above step, the `Model`'s `deleteTask()` will be called to delete the task from TrackIt
4. The `Model`'s `getModuleLessons()` is called to get the list of lessons that are associated with the module. 
5. For each lesson received from the above step, the `Model`'s `deleteLesson()` will be called to delete the lesson from TrackIt
7. The `Model`'s `deleteModule()` is called to delete the module from TrackIt
8. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the GUI.
9. Assuming the above steps are all successful, the `DeleteModuleCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The following Sequence Diagram will illustrate the above steps in greater detail :

In this section, we will use the following Activity Diagram to outline the parse & execution of a EditModuleCommand

![Activity diagram for Edit Module Command](images/EditModuleCommandActivityDiagram.png)

When the user enters the `M edit CODE` command to edit a module, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in 
[Section 3.3 Logic Component](#logic). If the parse process is successful, a `EditModuleCommand` will be returned an its `execute` method will be called.

The following steps will describe the execution of the `EditModuleCommand` in detail, assuming no errors are encountered.
1. The `Model`'s `getModule(code)` is called and it will return an Optional<Module> to edit. If the returned optional is empty, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
2. The `Model`'s `createEditedModule` is called to create the new `editedModule` to replace the old `Module`
3. If `editedModule` is equal to the old `Module`, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. If the `code` of `editedModule` coincides with one of the `code` of existing module, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
5. If the `code` of the `editedModule` is different from the old `Module`'s `code`:
    1. The `Model`'s `getModuleTasks()` is called to get the list of tasks that are associated with the module
    2. For each task in the above step, a `newTask` is created by replacing its old `code` with the new `code`, then `Model`'s `setTask()` is called to replace `oldTask` with `newTask`
    3. The `Model`'s `getModuleLessons()` is called to get the list of lessons that are associated with the module
    4. For each lesson in the above step, a `newLesson` is created by replacing its old `code` with the new `code`, then `Model`'s `setLesson()` is called to replace `oldLesson` with `newLesson`
    5. The `Model`'s `getModuleContacts()` is called to get the list of contacts that associated with the module
    6. For each contact in the above step, a `newContact` is created by deleting the old `code` from the set of tags and add in the new `code`, then `Model`'s `setContact()` is called to replace `oldContact` with `newContact`
7. The `Model`'s `setModule()` is called to edit the module from TrackIt
8. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the GUI.
9. Assuming the above steps are all successful, the `EditModuleCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The following Sequence Diagram will illustrate the above steps in greater detail :

### **4.2. Lesson Manager** <a name="lesson-manager"></a>
(Contributed by Minh)

TrackIt@NUS allows users to keep track of their weekly lessons. The lesson manager is one of TrackIt@NUS's basic components.

The common commands for the lesson manager include:

* `add` - Creates a new lesson
* `edit` - Modifies an existing lesson
* `delete` - Deletes an existing lesson

TrackIt@NUS also gives users a better understanding of their lessons by allowing users to view lessons in certain 
categories. Users can view lessons specific to a module and lessons on a specific day.

#### 4.2.1 Rationale <a name="lesson-manager-rationale"></a>
(Contributed by Minh)
 
Lessons are an integral part of any student's day-to-day life. Hence, TrackIt@NUS includes a lesson manager for students to 
 keep track of their lessons. Each lesson must belong to a unique module. When users click into a specific module tab, 
 they can see the lessons belonging to that module.
   
:warning: The module must exist (i.e. there must be a module with the specified `CODE`), otherwise, the `add` and
 `edit` commands will not work.
 
#### 4.2.2 Current Implementation <a name="lesson-manager-implementation"></a>
(Contributed by Minh)
 
 In this section, we will outline the key operations of the Lesson Manager, namely:
 * `AddLessonCommand`
 * `DeleteLessonCommand`
 * `EditLessonCommand`
 
 We will also elaborate on one more key operation that is used in the module tabs, namely `getModuleLessons`.
  
 The `add`, `delete`, and `edit` commands are all implemented in similar ways. When executed they will:
  * call on the relevant Model methods
  * update the `UniqueLessonList` depending on the command
  * Save the updated lesson list to `data/trackIter.json`
  * return the relevant CommandResult message
 
 The following steps will describe the execution of the `AddLessonCommand`, assuming no errors are encountered:
 
 1. When `AddLessonCommand` is executed, it will first call the model's `hasModule` method to ensure that the specified module exists
 2. Following this, it will call the model's `hasLesson` method to ensure that the lesson does not yet exist in the app
 3. If both checks pass, `AddLessonCommand` will call the model's `addLesson` method
 4. The model will then call the `addLesson` method of TrackIter, and adds the lesson to the app.
 
 ![Add Lesson Activity Diagram](images/AddLessonActivityDiagram.png)
 
 The following shows the sequence diagram of the `AddLessonCommand`.
 
 ![Add Lesson Sequence Diagram](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram.png)
 
 The following steps will describe the execution of the `DeleteLessonCommand`, assuming no errors are encountered:
 
 1. When the `DeleteLessonCommand` is executed, it will first call the model's `getFilteredLessonList` method 
 to determine the last shown list of lessons
 2. Then, it will call the index's `getZeroBased` method to find the zero-based index of the lesson it must delete
 3. Then, it will check if this index is within range
 4. If it is, it calls the model's `deleteLesson` method.
 5. The model will then call the `removeLesson` method of TrackIter, which deletes the lesson in question from the app.

 2. Then, it will call the index's `getZeroBased` method to find the zero-based index of the lesson we must edit
 3. It will then check if the index is within range
 4. If it is, it calls the model's `setLesson` method
 5. The model will then call the `setLesson` method of TrackIter, which replaces the original lesson with the edited
  version in the app.

 The `getModuleLessons` function takes in a Module Code and returns all lessons that belong to the specified module.
  When `getModuleLessons` is called, it uses the `LessonHasCodePredicate` to update the lesson list in the app to only show
  the lessons that belong to the specified module code.
 
 This is the sequence diagram of `getModuleLessons`.

### 4.3 **Task Manager** <a name="task-manager"></a>
(Contributed by Simon)

TrackIt@NUS allows users to keep track of his/her tasks. The task manager is one of TrackIt@NUS's basic components.

The common commands for the task manager include:

* `add` - Creates a new task
* `edit` - Modifies an existing task
* `delete` - Deletes an existing task

TrackIt@NUS also gives users a better understanding of their tasks by allowing users to view tasks in certain
 categories. Users can view overdue tasks, tasks on a specific day, future tasks (tasks that have deadlines more than
  a week away), and specific module tasks.
 
#### 4.3.1 Rationale <a name="task-manager-rationale"><a/>
(Contributed by Simon)
 
 Tasks are an integral part of any student's day-to-day life. Hence, TrackIt@NUS includes a task manager for students to 
 keep track of all their tasks. To better support NUS students, a task can either belong to a module or not. When
  adding a task, users can choose to the include the `m/CODE` parameter in order to add a task that belongs to
   a module. When users click into a specific module tab, they can see the tasks belonging to each module.
    
:information_source: A task does not have to belong a module. In this case, the module parameter of the task is
 simply treated as null and the task can only be viewed in the upcoming tab.
     
:warning: The module must exist (i.e. there must be a module with the specified `CODE`) otherwise the add and
 edit commands will not work.
 
:bulb: To remove a task from a module, simply type `T edit INDEX m/` (use the `m/` prefix but leave the `CODE` parameter empty).

#### 4.3.2 Current Implementation <a name="task-manager-implementation"><a/>
(Contributed by Simon)

In this section, we will outline the key operations of the Task Manager, namely:
* `AddTaskCommand`
* `DeleteTaskCommand`
* `EditTaskCommand`

We will also elaborate on one more key operation that is used in the module tabs, namely `getModuleTasks
`, `getOverdueTasks`, `getDayUpcomingTasks`, `getFutureTasks`.
 
The add, delete, and edit commands are all implemented in similar ways. When they are executed they will:
 * call on the relevant Model methods
 * update the `UniqueTaskList` depending on the command
 * Save the updated task list to `data/trackIter.json`
 * return the relevant CommandResult message

The following steps will describe the execution of the `AddTaskCommand`, assuming no errors are encountered:
 
1. When `AddTaskCommand` is executed, it will first call the model's `hasTask` method to ensure that the task does not yet exist in the app
2. Following this, if the task is added with a non-null module code, it will call the model's
  `hasModule` method to ensure that the specified module exists
3. If both these checks pass, `AddTaskCommand` will call the model's `addTask` method.
4. The model will then call the `addTask` method of TrackIter, and adds the task to the app.

![Add Task Activity Diagram](images/AddTaskActivityDiagram.png)

The following shows the sequence diagram of the `AddTaskCommand`.

2. Then, it will call the index's `getZeroBased` method to find the zero-based index of the task it must delete
3. Then, it will check if this index is within range

![Edit Task Command Activity Diagram](images/EditTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The follow shows the sequence diagram of the `EditTaskCommand` assuming no errors are encountered.

![Edit Task Sequence Diagram](images/EditTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

The `getModuleTasks` function takes in a Module Code and returns all tasks that belong to the specified module.
. When `getModuleTasks` is called, it uses the `TaskHasCodePredicate` to update the task list in the app to only show
 the tasks that belong the specified module code.

This is the sequence diagram of `getModuleTasks`.

![Get Module Tasks Sequence Diagram](images/GetModuleTasksSequenceDiagram.png)

`getOverdueTasks`, `getDayUpcomingTasks`, and `getFutureTasks` are all implemented in very similar ways. In fact, the
 only differences are the predicates used.

#### 4.3.3 Design Considerations <a name="task-manager-design"><a/>
(Contributed by Simon)
   
As mentioned, a task may or may not belong to a module. In the case it does not, we store the module code as
 null. A task also may or may not have a remark. In the case it does not, we store the remark as the empty
  string. These 2 optional fields made the `EditTaskCommand` more challenging to implement. We wanted the user to be
   able to remove an existing module code or remark simply by typing `T edit INDEX m/` and `T edit INDEX r/` respectively.
     
![Edit Task Activity Diagram](images/EditTaskActivityDiagram.png)
   
The original AB3 implementation of edit commands, which would default to the original field if the edited
 field was null, would not be sufficient. Hence, we added 2 additional boolean variables - `isRemarkChanged` and
  `isCodeChanged`, to know whether users wanted to remove the existing module code or remark.
 
### 4.4 **Contact Manager** <a name="contact-manager"></a>
(Contributed by Minh)

TrackIt@NUS allows users to manage their contacts. The contact manager is one of TrackIt@NUS's basic components.

The common commands for the contact manager include:

* `add` - Creates a new contact
* `edit` - Modifies an existing contact
* `delete` - Deletes an existing contact
 
We will also elaborate on one more key operation that is used in the module tabs, namely `getModuleContacts`.
 
#### 4.4.1 Rationale <a name="contact-manager-rationale"></a>
(Contributed by Minh)
 
 Managing contacts is an essential part of any student's life. Hence, TrackIt@NUS includes a contact manager for students to 
 keep track of all their contacts. To better support NUS students, a contact can hold any number (can be 0) of tags. If a tag matches 
 an existing module code, editing/deleting the module will edit/delete the tag as well.
    
:bulb: To remove all tags from a contact, simply type `C edit INDEX t/` (use the `t/` prefix but do not provide any tag).

#### 4.4.2 Current Implementation <a name="contact-manager-implementation"></a>
(Contributed by Minh)

In this section, we will outline the key operations of the Contact Manager, namely:
* `AddContactCommand`
* `DeleteContactCommand`
* `EditContactCommand`
 
The `add`, `delete`, and `edit` commands are all implemented in similar ways. When they are executed they will:
 * call on the relevant Model methods
 * update the `UniqueContactList` depending on the command
 * Save the updated contact list to `data/trackIter.json`
 * return the relevant CommandResult message

The following steps will describe the execution of the `AddContactCommand`, assuming no errors are encountered:
 
1. When `AddContactCommand` is executed, it will first call the model's `hasContact` method to ensure that the contact 
does not yet exist in the app.
2. If the check passes, `AddContactCommand` will call the model's `addContact` method.
3. The model will then call the `addContact` method of TrackIter, and adds the contact to the app.

![Add Contact Activity Diagram](images/AddContactActivityDiagram.png)

The `getModuleContacts` function takes in a Module Code and returns all contacts that have a tag that matches the specified module.
When `getModuleContacts` is called, it uses the `ContactHasTagPredicate` to update the contact list in the app to only show
 the contacts that have the desired tag.

This is the sequence diagram of `getModuleContacts`.

![Get Module Contacts Sequence Diagram](images/GetModuleContactsSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.4.2 Design Considerations <a name="contact-manager-design"></a>
(Contributed by Minh)

A number of fields in a contact (namely phone number and e-mail address) are optional. In the case they are not specified, 
 we store them as null. Similar to tasks, we wanted users to be able to remove any optional field simply by 
  specifying the `/p` or `/e` flag without providing a parameter.
   
![Remove Phone Number Activity Diagram](images/RemovePhoneNumberActivityDiagram.png)
   
The original AB3 implementation of edit commands, which would default to the original field if the edited
 field was null, would not be sufficient. Hence, we added 2 additional boolean variables - `isPhoneChanged` and 
  `isEmailChanged`, to know whether users wanted to remove the existing phone number and/or e-mail address.

### 4.5 **Logging** <a name="logging"></a>
(Contributed by Simon)

* We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
* The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations
*  The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
*  Log messages are output through the console and to a `.log` file
*  The output logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (see
 [Configuration](#config) for more info)
* When choosing a level for a log message, follow the conventions stated below

#### 4.5.1 Logging Levels <a name="logging-levels"></a>

* `SEVERE`: A critical problem detected which may cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE`: Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### **4.6. Configuration** <a name="config"></a>

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user preferences file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

| --------- | --------------- |
| **Mainstream OS** <a name="oop"></a> | Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X |
| **CRUD** <a name="crud"></a> | The four basic functions any application should have: <ul><li>Create</li><li>Read</li><li>Update</li><li>Delete</li></ul> |
| **Object Oriented Programming** <a name="oop"></a> | A type of computer programming paradigm (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. |
| **Facade Pattern** <a name="facade-p"></a> | A structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework. While decreasing the overall complexity of the application, it also helps to move unwanted dependencies to one place. |

## **Appendix G: Effort** <a name="appen-g"></a>
(Contributed by Long)

The team has put in a tremendous amount of effort to this project, with a single simple principle in mind: create an app
 that our targeted users will prefer over existing commercial apps, and do so while maintain a production-grade
  codebase. In the following section, the effort will be further elaborated.
  
### App's functionality & User Experience

When we first start the project, we were quite surprised that the app must be optimized for CLI, which is not a common thing for most of the commercial apps nowadays. 
Hence, tremendous effort has been put into optimizing the app for the most natural & intuitive User Experience (more details in the Feature Design Consideration). 

To achieve that, the team has had countless debates on how new features should be implemented, and there were even a topic about task's remark that took the team 3 days of debate to settle. 


4 days before the deadline, the app didn't have the edit module features, since we knew for sure that an user will almost never need to edit a module's name or code while using the app (since if they entered it wrongly in the first place they could have fixed it right away).
Yet, because of the strive for perfection, we didn't want to leave a possible situation where "bad" UX happens (Since in the extremely rare case some users will still need to edit that). So we decided to write an additional few hundreds LOC, and did a lot more testing for that new feature (Since EditModule is a very complicated feature to implement)

We don't aim to create an app with a load of features, but aim to create one with just enough features to get all tasks done, and to make our users feel comfortable & happy in the process.
Our app may look "simple", but **simple is the ultimate sophistication**. 

### Compared to AB3
Our app can be thought of as a superset of AB3. AB3 was concerned primarily with the management of contacts. We recognised that contacts and friends were a crucial part of any student’s life. Hence, we decided to build upon AB3 by altering the app to be suited for students, and so that the app could help students conveniently manage their student lives.

Hence, we decided to implement module, lesson, and task managers on top of the existing AB3 contacts manager. Now, students will be able to keep track of all their academic and social commitments with a single app, where they previously had to use 4. 

We put in a lot of effort to add these 3 extra features, working late most nights before our v1.2 demo. Furthermore, we decided after that we should integrate all 4 core features seamlessly, to improve upon the existing user experience. As such, for v1.3 users were able to:
* View all tasks, lessons, and contacts related to a module
* View all upcoming tasks, and lessons
* View all future tasks
Again, this was no easy feat, and our team worked tirelessly to finish our features before v1.3.
 
We also enhanced the UI by introducing colour coding, making the fonts more aesthetic, and changing the default heights and widths to make the app more user-friendly. All these changes were extremely important to the overall user experience, and we knew that we had to get them just right, because the users will appreciate the little things that we do just to improve their user experience.
 
### Maintaining a high-quality codebase

The code quality of the repo has been maintained at a high standard throughout the project. Following are the steps we took to maintain that:
* All codes to be merged in requires an additional proof-read & approval from another team member

* All codes to be merged in must follow the logic design principle & coding rules mentioned in "Code Design Principle" section.

* IntelliJ's code formatter were used throughout the entire development

* The repo were cleaned up & refactored once or twice a week by a designated team member who will read all the codes

* In additional to the above, during the code read up, any part of functioning codes that can be improved to be less bug-prone or cleaner will also be discussed and improve.

At the final stage of the project, the code has also gone through 3 different static analysis tool: 
* IntelliJ's inspection tool (with many additional warnings turned on)
* [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [PMD](https://pmd.github.io)

All warnings received by the three app have been looked into and necessary fixes have been done to ensure a high-quality codebase.

We are proud of this product!
